- [x] Qian-Bei Hong, Chung-Hsien Wu, Hsin-Min Wang, Chien-Lin Huang. *Statistics Pooling Time Delay Neural Network Based on X-Vector for Speaker Verification.* [[ICASSP 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9054350)]
  - `TI-SV` `VoxCeleb` `SITW`
  -  Concat the outputs of local statistics pooling in each TDNN layer.

### FR1.Poster C: Speaker Recognition Systems, Data and Features

- [x] Hao Lu, Jianfeng Zhou, Miao Zhao, Wendian Lei, Qingyang Hong, Lin Li. *XMU-TS Systems for NIST SRE19 CTS Challenge.* [[ICASSP 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053080)]
  - `SI-SV` `NIST` `Fusion` `Domain mismatch` `AS-Norm`
  - TDNN, TDNN-f, ResNet
  - MFCC, FBank, PLP + pitch
  - Employ length normalization, centering, whitening and LDA before domain adapted PLDA scoring for eliminating domain mismatch.
